The difference between %I and %d in C is that %I is a format specifier for 
integers of any base, while %d is a format specifier for decimal integers. 
This means that %I can be used to read and write integers in decimal, octal,
 or hexadecimal format, 
 while %d can only be used to read and write integers in decimal format.

When using %I in scanf(),
the compiler will automatically detect the base of the input integer based on 
the prefix of the input. 
or example, 
if the input integer is prefixed with 0, 
the compiler will interpret it as an octal integer. 
If the input integer is prefixed with 0x, 
the compiler will interpret it as a hexadecimal integer. 
Otherwise, the compiler will interpret it as a decimal integer.

When using %d in scanf(), 
the compiler will assume that the input integer is in decimal format. 
If the input integer is not in decimal format, 
the compiler will produce an error.

When using %I or %d in printf(), 
the compiler will simply print the integer value in the specified format.
